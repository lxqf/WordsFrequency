The Apple software, tools, utilities, sample or example code, documentation, interfaces, content, data, and other materials accompanying this License, whether on disk, print or electronic documentation, in read only memory, or any other media or in any other form, (collectively, the "Developer Software") are licensed, not sold, to you by Apple Inc. ("Apple") for use only under the terms of this License.  Apple and/or Appleâ€™s licensors retain ownership of the Developer Software itself and reserve all rights not expressly granted to you. The terms of this License will govern any software upgrades provided by Apple that replace and/or supplement the original Developer Software, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license in which case the terms of that license will govern. 
The system-provided images owned by Apple and documented as such in Apple's Human Interface Guidelines for OS X and iOS ("System-Provided Images") are licensed to you solely for the purpose of developing OS X and iOS applications, respectively, using the Developer Software. Upon termination of this License, you may continue to distribute the System-Provided Images as used within software you developed using the Developer Software; however, you agree to provide to Apple, at Apple's request, a copy of any software you developed using the Developer Software that incorporates any of the System-Provided Images so Apple may determine, in its sole discretion, whether your use of the System-Provided Images complies with these terms.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, you are granted a limited, non-exclusive license to use the Developer Software on Apple-branded computers to develop and test application and other software. You may make only as many internal use copies of the Developer Software as reasonably necessary to use the Developer Software as permitted under this License and distribute such copies only to your employees whose job duties require them to so use the Developer Software; provided that you reproduce on each copy of the Developer Software or portion thereof, all copyright or other proprietary notices contained on the original.
